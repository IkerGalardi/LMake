# Versioning scheme

This project uses the semver versioning system. This versioning system can be found in its [website](https://semver.org/). But in summary, these are the points that this projects version follow: 

* The versioning system follows the X.Y.Z format: where X is the major version, which will specify the base for the public API (lmake functions and command line options); where Y is the minor version, which specifies minor and incremental changes from the base API; and where Z is the patch version, which just apply bugfixes (no functionality added).

* Excepting major version changes, all lmake versions are retrocompatible. If that is not the case, a bug has ocurred.
